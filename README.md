# BooksApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Prerequisites

You should have Node.js version 8.x or greater and npm version 5.x or greater. Check the version by typing in `npm -v` and `node -v` into your terminal. If they are not up to date, you will have to update them before going further. To run ng commands, you should have the Angular CLI installed. Install it globally using this command:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

You will also need to install node modules. Run `npm install` to do this. You may need to run these commands using sudo to run them as root (`sudo npm install`).

## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. Once built, your browser will navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
